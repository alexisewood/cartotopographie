      The Afterlife of Measurement
    </h1>

    <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.75; margin-top:20px;">
      In 1875, a 3,500-pound reflective cone was hauled to the summit of Mount Shasta and installed as part of a national geodetic survey. The instrument was meant to collapse distance—to translate 192 miles of mountain air into a measurable relation between peaks. For a brief moment, the mountain became infrastructure. Then the snow returned.

      I. The Mountain as Instrument
    </h2>

    <p>
      The late nineteenth century was an age of measurement. Across the American West, survey teams climbed summits, erected signals, and stitched the continent into geometric coherence. The work was technical, grueling, and deeply political. To measure land is to claim it; to triangulate a mountain is to embed it within a system of governance.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Mount Shasta’s north peak, surveyors installed a massive reflective cone and base to serve as a relay point in a transcontinental mapping network. Light flashed from summit to summit. Angles were recorded. Lines were drawn. The mountain—once volcanic mass, spiritual site, and regional landmark—became a platform for national calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a kind of technological sublime: the promise that human precision could master continental scale. Granite became coordinate. Elevation became geometry. The landscape entered the ledger.

    <h2 style="font-family:Cinzel, serif; letter-spacing:.08em; text-transform:uppercase;">
      II. Extraction and Governance
    </h2>

    <p>
      Surveying was never only about knowledge. It was about administration, extraction, and control. The same systems that mapped summits also organized mining claims, timber rights, railroad corridors, and county lines. Measurement structured who could own, extract, and profit.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Northern California, technological feats often followed a familiar arc: installation, economic expansion, decline, and abandonment. Infrastructure arrived as triumph. It lingered as debris.
    </p>

    <p>
      The geodetic signal on Shasta belonged to this pattern. It was built to endure, yet it depended on funding cycles, political will, and a belief in progress that proved uneven. The mountain did not resist measurement so much as outlast it.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Cinzel, serif; letter-spacing:.08em; text-transform:uppercase;">
      III. Ruin and Afterlife
    </h2>

    <p>
      Snow and ice eventually encased the signal. For years at a time, it disappeared beneath seasonal freeze. Later generations rediscovered it. Funds were raised to restore it. Eventually it was removed and placed in a museum.
    </p>

    <p>
      The relay survived—not as infrastructure, but as artifact. The promise of permanence gave way to the slow sediment of memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, what remains is not the network but the trace. The mountain absorbed the project. The metal cone persists as a relic of a moment when geometry promised to stabilize the continent.

      Why a Map?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The interactive rings on this site are not simply contour lines. They are a way of staging this history spatially. Each ring represents an elevation band, but also a fold in time—a point where ambition, labor, environment, and neglect converge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clicking a ring opens a fragment. Together, they form a layered cartographic essay: not a linear narrative, but a field of relays. The map does not illustrate the argument. It performs it.
